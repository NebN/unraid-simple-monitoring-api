# Unraid Simple Monitoring API
Simple rest API to monitor basic metrics, currently supports:
- Disk utilization
- Network traffic
- CPU load
- Memory utilization

Originally created for [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) for use with [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/latest/widgets/services/customapi/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Migrated from DockerHub to GitHub Container Registry.
> 
> If you have installed before April 2024 please reinstall or manually change

## Utilization with Unraid <a id="unraid"></a> 
### Installation <a id="unraid-install"></a>
Install from the Unraid community apps

### Configuration <a id="unraid-conf"></a>
By default the application expects a configuration file in 
```
/mnt/user/appdata/unraid-simple-monitoring-api/conf.yml
```

You can find an example file [here](https://github.com/NebN/unraid-simple-monitoring-api/blob/master/conf/conf.yml). It should look like this

```yaml
networks:
  - eth0
  - anotherNetwork
disks:
  cache:
    - /mnt/cache
    - /another/cache/mount
  array:
    - /mnt/disk1
    - /mnt/disk2
```

Optionally you can specify the desired level of logging by adding the following line
```yaml
loggingLevel: DEBUG
```
Accepted values are `DEBUG` `INFO` `WARN` and `ERROR`, it defaults to `INFO`. 

### ZFS <a id="unraid-zfs"></a>
If any of the mount points listed in the configuration are using ZFS, the application  needs to be run as privileged in order to obtain the correct utilization of ZFS datasets. Essentially the command `zfs list` is being used to obtain the correct information, as conventional disk reading methods do not  seem work.

If you are comfortable with running the container as privileged, follow these steps:
- Unraid Docker Tab
- `unraid-simple-monitoring-api` > Edit
- Change `Privileged:` to `ON`
- Apply

You can always decide to turn `Privileged:` back to `OFF`.
> [!TIP]
> If you are not using ZFS, there is no reason to run the container as privileged.

### Calling the API <a id="unraid-use"></a>
Make a request to 
```
http://your-unraid-ip:24940
```

The response will be formatted this way.

## Integration with Homepage <a id="homepage"></a> 
![image](https://github.com/NebN/unraid-simple-monitoring-api/assets/57036949/0175ffbd-fe84-494c-a29f-264f09aae6f3)
### Configuration <a id="homepage-conf"></a>
Official homepage custom API widget documentation: https://gethomepage.dev/latest/widgets/services/customapi/.  
Your homepage `services.yml` should look like this if you want for example cache and network data. Homepage limits the widget to 4 items.

```yml
- Category:
   - Unraid:
        icon: unraid.png
        href: http://<your-unraid-ip>
        widget:
          type: customapi
          url: http://<your-unraid-ip>:24940
          method: GET # this doesn't matter
          mappings:
            - field:
                cache_total: free
              label: cache free
              format: number
              suffix: "GiB"
            - field:
                cache_total: free_percent
              label: percent
              format: percent
            - field:
                network_total: rx_MiBs
              label: rx
              format: float
              suffix: MiB/s
            - field:
                network_total: tx_MiBs
              label: tx
              format: float
              suffix: MiB/s
```

## How reliable are the measurements? <a id="caveat"></a>
The goal of this API is to be simple, fast, and lightweight.  
For these reasons, the measurements provided are not as accurate as they could be.

### Disk
Disk utilization is rounded down to the nearest GiB.

### Network and CPU
Both Network and CPU usage need to be measured for some time interval. Typically, to get an accurate measurement, you would monitor these for a few seconds before providing a response.  
To avoid having to either:
- wait for the measurement to be completed before responding
- continuosly measure them to have a recent measurement ready to respond with

A different approach has been taken: a snapshot of Network and CPU usage is taken every time the API is called, and the response is the average Network and CPU usage between the current and last API call.
This ensures that the response is quick and reasonably accurate, without having the process continuously read Network and CPU data even when not required.

## Installing a QA build <a id="qa"></a>  
Everyone's Unraid setup is different, therefore, when implementing a new feature or fixing a bug specific to a certain setup, it might be necessary that the end user (you) install a testing deployment to verify that everything works as expected.  

To do so follow these steps:
- Unraid Docker Tab
- `unraid-simple-monitoring-api` > Stop
- Add container
- Template > `unraid-simple-monitoring-api`
- Change the name to something else, e.g.: `unraid-simple-monitoring-api-QA`
- Change `Repository:` to `ghcr.io/nebn/unraid-simple-monitoring-api:qa` (The actual tag might change, currently using `qa`)
- Apply

You should now have 2 installations on your Docker Tab, and can switch between them by stopping/starting them. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Avoid having both active at the same time, as they share the same port and would therefore be unable to start the HTTP service.
